- 👋 Hi, I’m @Chacho104
- 👀 I’m interested in full-stack web development. I enjoy building beautiful, interactive, and responsive websites and web apps from the ground all the way up using pure HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript or using React.js. I prefer using Node.js for back-end development and I am comfortable with both relational and nonrelational databases.
- 🌱 I’m currently focusing on becoming a full-stack JavaScript developer by diving deep into React.js and Node.js. I aspire to become an expert in the MERN stack in the next 6 or so months.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any web development project that seeks to solve real world problems faced by individuals and business across the world.
